# hyper-dark-scrollbar
Dark scrollbar for [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper) - a plugin that stylizes the chunky Windows-ish scrollbar into a more sleek scrollbar.

The scrollbar is originally designed for [hyperterm-atom-dark](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark), however, it also looks great on the standard theme, and should look fine on dark themes, as it utilises the theme background color. You're ~welcome~ encouraged to fork this project and modify it if you need to tinker with the colors to fit your theme better, or create a PR if I missed something that needs fixing.

### Install

**Hyper store**:
```
hyper i hyper-dark-scrollbar
```

**Manually**:

1. Open Hyper's preferences with `Ctrl+,` (or manually at `~/.hyper.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include hyper-dark-scrollbar, like so:

        plugins: [
            'hyper-dark-scrollbar'
        ],

3. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart Hyper and voila!

### Attention

If you have added a theme to Hyper, you will need to make sure `hyper-dark-scrollbar` is loaded **_after_** the theme; preferably last. Otherwise the utilisation of the `color`-package won't work, and you'll end up with whatever colors are defined in your `~/.hyper.js`.

Check your `~/.hyper.js` and make sure it look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    config: {

        // ...

        plugins: [
            'theme',
            // other plugins
            'hyper-dark-scrollbar'
        ],

        // ...
    }
}
```
